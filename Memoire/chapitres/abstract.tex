\textbf{Abstract Provisoire}\\

This thesis focuses on the optimization of deep learning algorithms for the real-time detection and recognition of military vehicles in images and videos.
The primary objective is to study the state-of-the-art methods and propose improvements based on the integration of advanced techniques such as generative models and data augmentation.
The ADOMVI project, to which this work has contributed, aims to optimize the performance of detection models like YoloV8, considering the specific constraints of the military domain, including data scarcity and varying visibility conditions.
The results demonstrate a significant improvement in detection and recognition performance while highlighting persistent challenges related to the robustness of models in real-world conditions.
This thesis concludes with the necessity to continue research to refine these algorithms and adapt technological solutions to the needs of defense operations.
